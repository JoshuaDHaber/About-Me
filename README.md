# About-Me

  So who am I and why should you care? Well seeing that you have found my profile repositiory, I will tell you why. I am someone who has both changed majors and adopted a double major in my time at RIT. I am the person who has never worked less than the maximum 20 hours a week for the past 8 semesters while maintaining a 3.85 GPA. I am the person who will take any curveball thrown my way and embrace it with open arms. 

  After internships with PNC Financial Services, Lavner Camps and Programs, RIT Information and Technology Services, and NTID Client Services, I have never done the same thing twice. Whether it be Agile or DevOps, helpdesk or teaching kids how to kids, I have dabbled in many fields to make myself as versatile as possible. I have been deep in the trenches and at a high level identifying requirements and writing user stories. I pride myself on being able to identify area of need and make sure that they can be addressed in a timely manner. Please check out my resume for a more detailed explanation of the skills, tools, and trades I have picked up over the years.
